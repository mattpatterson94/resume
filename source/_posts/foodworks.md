Foodworks was my first job while at school. Here at Foodworks I was one of the sales assistants, which meant I spent my time on the checkout, putting stock away and closing and opening the store. At Foodworks I learnt a lot about communication and customer service, which helps me to engage in conversations with clients, building relationships and offering small talk when necessary.
