Silicon Lakes is a not-for-profit tech startup incubator and accelerator based in Gold Coast, Australia. At Silicon Lakes, I was part of a program that was created to assist local entrepreneurs to get their ideas off the ground and create an MVP. I signed up as a volunteer to assist the startups where necessary and give them any guidance I could. Most of my time was spent assisting a project which was built in Python. The goal of the project was to aggregate cloud based data storage as a way for businesses to manage their storage hosted on multiple platforms, keeping all their files organised and unified.
