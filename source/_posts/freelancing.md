As a means to enhance my skills outside of work and earning some extra profit, I started offering freelance work on my time off. I have been working with a design agency called [Bona Fide Design Co](https://www.bonafidedesignco.com) and offering web services on their behalf. I developed their website in Wordpress, allowing them to manage their content independently. At this point in time I am accepting freelance work in services such as web development, wordpress development and mobile application development.
