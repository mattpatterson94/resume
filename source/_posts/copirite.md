Copirite is a Gold Coast based company which specialises in Design, Print, Signage and Web based services. I worked alongside another web developer to create and maintain internal systems which ran the business, performing backend and frontend development services. These systems were built on Ruby on Rails. I also solely handled the development of client websites, which were primarily built on Wordpress, and occasionally with Ruby on Rails. On a daily basis I was performing ad-hoc work for client websites, building, maintaining and keeping client websites up to date, creating new features and bug fixing the internal systems.

Primary technologies used:
* Ruby / Ruby on Rails
* PHP / Wordpress
* CSS3 / HTML5
* Stimulus / jQuery / React

During my time at Copirite, I spent a lot of time developing my Ruby skills, as well as learning techniques to enhance my general programming skills, including:
* Test-driven Development
* Agile Practices
* Project management tools
* Server Maintenance
* AWS Platforms
* Continuous Integration Platforms
* Continuous Deployment
* Responsible for ensuring stability of crucial company systems
* Playing around with new technologies

I single-handedly developed and maintained a research foundation website for [P.A Hospital](https://pafoundation.org.au). This site was built in Ruby and features a fully custom CMS, and a working e-store which allows payments from Stripe and PayPal. Once the site was up and running it was cloned twice for a further two fundraising endeavours run by P.A Hospital, [Project Pink](https://projectpink.org.au) and [Mandate](https://mandate.org.au).
