iOnline is a digital agency based in Gold Coast, Australia which provides website design and development services to companies Australia wide. At iOnline, I built websites for clients using our custom-built CMS, as well as Wordpress and Laravel. On a daily basis I was handling emails from clients, performing ad-hoc tasks at the clients request, and building client websites.

Primary technologies used:
* PHP / Wordpress
* HTML5 / CSS
* JavaScript / jQuery

My experience at iOnline gave me the following:
* Working as a team
* Enhancing my web development skills while still at University
* Industry experience
* Communicating with clients and handling projects
